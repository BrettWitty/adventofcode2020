# Advent of Code 2020

These are my attempts at the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). I'm doing it primarily in Rust to get my skills up.

I'm using:
- [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) to automate all the boring parts.


## Python version

Under `python/` I'm attempting the same thing (without automation) in Python because I'm super-comfortable there.


## Writeups

I'll attempt to capture my thinking on each problem.

1. [Day 1](day1.md) - Report Repair
2. [Day 2](day2.md) - Password Philosophy
